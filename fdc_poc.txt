Using HTML injection I was able to bypass the Firefox restrictions and access the desktop and the root folder.

1. After logging in as yourself[inmate] click on Law Library.

2. In the Fast Case search box turn the query to a link that refers to the SSL enabled site(the domain suggests local *.sjm(smartjailmail)) like so:

<a href="https://www.inmate-interface.sjm">random_text</a>

3. Click the link that shows up in the results.

4. A button that says “Get me out of here” appears. Click it.

5. A fresh Firefox page loads. At the bottom, click Extensions.

6. Disable the add-on that limits the menu/tool bars.

7. Click Restart Firefox.

8. Under customize, there is an ‘Open file…’ button. This accessed the root folder and opened any filetype supported by Firefox.
